# O-OFDMNet
This includes Python implementation of O-OFDMNet, a deep learning-based optical OFDM system, which uses neural networks for signal processing in the time-domain. Here, only AWGN channel is considered, while the codes for frequency-selective channels as well as channel coding will be updated shortly. 

Details can be found in the paper of O-OFDMNet:
